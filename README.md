A computer system connected to the concepts of networking, embedded systems, databases and security
computer science. This system will consist of a ground station equipped with a web interface
which will make it possible to launch exploration missions carried out by a team of two
robots, i.e. two AgileX Limo rover. The web interface will allow continuous visualization of the map
produced by the two robots, their position in the map explored by themself as well as their state. These robots, equipped with sensors, will have to explore
autonomously a room of a medium-sized building.
The mandate also requires designing a simulation system, using the
Gazebo simulator, allowing you to control the simulated robots via the same interface as
the ground station. This system will be used to conceptually test the algorithms
robot control and ground station functionalities before deploying them.
